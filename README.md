# polynomial_root_dichotomous_search
Find a root of a polynomial by the dichotomous algorithm.
There are a lot of methods to find a root for a polynomial. Here, I propose you to find it by the dichotomous algorithm.
The polynomial evaluation is performed by the [horner method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method).
You have two files:
- **library.py**: contains the functions used in the test program
- **test.py**: is the test program
Hope it will be useful.
