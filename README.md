# polynomial_root_dichotomous_search
Find a root of a polynomial by the dichotomic search algorithm. <br>
There are a lot of methods to find a root for a polynomial. Here, I propose you to find it by the [dichotomous search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomic_search).
The polynomial evaluation is performed by the [horner method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method). <br>
You have two files:
- **library.py**: contains the functions used in the test program
- **test.py**: is the test program <br>

Hope it will be useful.
